# SC1015 Project

## About

This is a project for Nanyang Technological University's SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on classifying and predicting future terrorism using dataset from [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/). For detailed walkthrough, please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/wlfrag/SC1015/blob/main/SC1015_DS_Mini_project_live.ipynb) and the below:

## Problem Definition
To predict impending future terrorism events and generating possible future events based on historic data.

## Models/Tools Used

1. `RandomForestClassifier`
2. `LinearRegression`
3. `DataSynthesizer`

## Visualization Tools Used

1. Waffle Chart
2. Time Series Heat Map 
3. Bar Chart
4. Private vs Synthetic Comparison Heatmaps
5. Chloropleth Map 

## Data-driven Insights

From our predicted results, we note that:
1) Countries such as `Iraq` are under --> **High Risk** of successfully being attacked
2) ``Afghanistan``, ``Pakistan`` are under --> **Moderate to High Risk**
3) ``Colombia``, ``Peru``, `Salvador`, ``Nigeria``, ``Somalia``, ``Yemen``, ``Turkey``, ``India``, ``Thailand``, ``Philippines`` are under --> **Moderate Risk**
4) Others --> **Relatively Low Risk**

Therefore, we successfully solved our initial problem statement:
1. Predicted impending future terrorism 
2. Generated possible future events based on historical data

- Countries that not only fall within the moderate- to high-risk categories, but also countries that share borders with these nations (e.g. ``Iran``, ``Syria``, ``Oman``) need to ramp up their monitoring regimes. Although this prediction is not definitive and fails to account for 2020's drop in terrorist activity, it can give good insight as to what terrorists' next move(s) could be

## Additional Insights

- Every country plays a role in defeating world terrorism; Each country should participate in having a shared data-pool of terroristic activities in their respective countries
- With such collated data, we can build a more robust classifier with greater accuracy of predictions
- While our model can be of great use to national security teams of the above countries as they prepare to monitor future threats, such information can easily fall into the wrong hands.
- If future terrorists get their hands on such prediction insights it will make it easier for them to 'escape the radar', which leads to more damage in the long run.
- Governments may benefit from using this prediction model as part of their arsenal of anti-terrorism measures, but never in place of it
- More insights can be found at the [end](https://github.com/wlfrag/SC1015/blob/main/SC1015_DS_Mini_project_live.ipynb) of the Jupyter Notebook.
